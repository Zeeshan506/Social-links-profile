# Social Links Profile

---

## Overview

This is my solution to the [Frontend Mentor Social Links Profile challenge](https://www.frontendmentor.io/challenges/social-links-profile-UG32l9m6dQ).  
The goal was to create a responsive profile card with social media links using HTML and Tailwind CSS.

## The Challenge

- Replicate the given Social Links Profile design as closely as possible.
- Ensure the layout is responsive for both mobile and desktop devices.
- Use semantic HTML and keep the code clean and readable.
- Apply hover effects with smooth transitions.

## Built With

- **HTML5** – for semantic structure
- **Tailwind CSS** – for styling and responsiveness
- **Flexbox** – for centering and layout alignment

## Live Demo

## What I Learned

- How to center content vertically and horizontally using Tailwind's `flex`, `justify-center`, and `items-center`.
- Using **custom hex colors** in Tailwind via `bg-[#hexcode]` and `text-[#hexcode]`.
- Colors in Tailwind apply to **text**, **background**, **borders**, and similar properties.
- Creating hover animations using `transition-colors` and setting speed with `duration-[ms]`.
- Building a vertically stacked layout using `flex-col` and `gap` utilities.
- Styling profile images with `rounded-full` for perfect circles.

## Tailwind Tips Learned

- **Custom Colors:**  
  Example: `bg-[#1f1f1f]` for background, `text-[#c5f82aff]` for text.
- **Rounded Corners:**  
  `rounded-full` for circular images, `rounded-lg` for card edges.
- **Transitions:**  
  `transition-colors` makes color changes smooth, and `duration-400` controls the animation speed.
- **Hover Effects:**  
  Combine `hover:bg-[color]` and `hover:text-[color]` for interactive buttons.
